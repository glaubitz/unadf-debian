Description: Extract files from an Amiga Disk File dump (.adf)
 Tool for extracting and listing files in an Amiga Disk File.
 .
 Amiga Disk File aka ADF is a file format used by Amiga computers and emulators
 to store images of disks. ADF is not really a file format but actually a
 track-by-track dump of the disk data as read by the Amiga operating system,
 and so the "format" is really fixed-width AmigaDOS data tracks appended one
 after another and held in a file.
